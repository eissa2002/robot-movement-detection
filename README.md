# robot-movement-detection
This Project is aimed to predict movement of robot using itâ€™s input of  XYZ axes and six degree of freedom output, to be able to predict outputs of  robot we will use three types of neural networks using MATLAB, we will use  Feed Forward, Generalized Regression and Radial Basis. We will compare  their accuracies and gain further insight.
